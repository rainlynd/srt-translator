Okay, I've reviewed the provided code files. Based on my analysis, here are some clarifying questions to ensure my understanding aligns with the intended design of the API concurrency system, especially for the SRT summary and translation stages:

1.  **Intended Concurrency Model for a Single File:**
    *   **Translation Chunks:** Yes the intent is to translate all chunks in a single file concurrently. It's also intended to translate ALL files concurrently as well
    *   **Summarization Chunks:** Summarizations should be done sequentially for each file, but multiple files can be summarized concurrently.

2.  **GlobalFileAdmissionController (GFC) Resource Sharing:**
    *   It is intended that both summarization and translation share the same RPM/TPM resources in the GFC.
    *   I'm not aware of this `type` parameter, you can delete it from the code if it is not used anywhere else.

3.  **Token Estimation for TPM:**
    These works well enough

4.  **Overall Workflow for Video Files:**
    Yes, the sequential behavior is intended, because using ASR for each file is a sequential process, and the summarization should wait for the ASR to complete before proceeding. The translation can run concurrently with the summarization of other files.

Answering these questions will help me confirm my understanding and accurately assess if the concurrency system is working as intended.
